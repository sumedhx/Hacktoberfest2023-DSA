# What is Binary Search

    Binary Search is a Searching algorithm used in a sorted array 
    by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

    • It as O(log N) Time Complexit.
    • The data structure must be sorted.
    • Access to any element of the data structure takes constant time.

# Problem Statement 
    • You have been given a sorted array of integers and target.
    • You have to find the index of the target element.

    #Test Case
    • Input -- [ 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 ]
    • Target -- 10
    • Output -- Index of Target Element

# Note 
    • binarySearch.dSYM is a file created by VS Code.
    • binarySearch.c is Source file.
    • File named "binarySearch" is compiled program.
